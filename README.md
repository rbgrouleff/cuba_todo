This is a sample todo app written with the micro webframework
[Cuba][cuba]. It was used for a presentation of Cuba at the
[Aarhus.rb][aarhusrb] meetup at March 13th.

[aarhusrb]: http://aarhusrb.dk

It is by NO means production grade code - and I do NOT encourage you to
use this for anything other than inspiration.
